#Good Enough

Good
-----
- Small, focused tests
- descriptive test names
- OO, Domain-driven design
- Small, focused methods

Neutral
-------
- "Mostly" test-driven, however I do see that quite a bit of functionality was added with only 1 test.  Overall it is light on tests


Not so good
-----------
- misspelling of "spare" (but I like "spear" much more, it makes bowling more exciting :-) )
- method naming; using "4" in place of the word "for"
- returning a string in an exception case instead of throwing an exception
- misnamed variables ("number" in moveToNextRollOrReset)
